	<h2>Summary:</h2>
<p>"Haven't you heard? I'm the vigilante. I clean up mess like you." -Aiden Pearce</p>
<p>He's the main character in Ubisoft's first Watch Dogs. Pearce is a hacker seeking revenge for the killing of his niece and goes up against mobsters, other hackers, and an evil megacorporation that's running a mass surveillance system on the city of Chicago.</p>
<p>He is a highly skilled grey hat hacker who has access to the CTOS of Chicago using a highly specialized device, the Profiler. Because his actions led to a family tragedy, Aiden has taken to a personal crusade against the powers that be. His obsession with security, surveillance, and control borders on the paranoid and dangerous, extending to monitoring his own family (unbeknownst to them).</p>
<p>Aiden was born on May 2, 1974 and grew up in Belfast, alongside his younger sixter Nicole. His mother took the siblings to the United States in order to escape from their father who was implied to have been an abusive parent. As a child, he grew up in a rough neighborhood and frequently had to protect his family. Over time, his mother slowly noticed how similar Aiden was becoming like his father and that her once sweet little boy had gone. He also learned about computers and grew to become a skilled hacker. As a young adult, Aiden became a member of a criminal gang. He purchased lessons in hand-to-hand combat, marksmanship and weapons all of which contributed towards his career as a thief. He also operated as a fixer which provided him deep insight of the criminal underworld.</p>
<p>Aiden later became an uncle when Nicole had two children named Jackson and Lena. In the unexplained absence of their father, Aiden acted as a parental figure to them growing up. He regularly brought them to the small town of Pawnee and often took them fishing. In 2005, Aiden was nearly arrested by a gym trainer who had noticed his injuries, and unable to afford the risk, he swiftly eliminated him. After this event, he began studying big cons, social engineering, psychology and intimidation tactics in order to ensure that he could win a fight before it had even begun. Aiden later became acquainted with a fellow hacker named Damien Brenks. The pair taught each other specific hacking skills and the two proved to be a strong team.</p>
